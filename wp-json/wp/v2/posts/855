THE FOLLOWING ARTICLE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Most\u00a0<strong>high-end refrigerators<\/strong>, such as <strong>Sub-Zero, Viking, <\/strong>have an\u00a0evaporator fan motor.\u00a0The evaporator fan motor is situated in the freezer compartment and is in charge of pulling air over the evaporator coils when the compressor is working. If you hear noise coming from your\u00a0<strong>high-end refrigerator<\/strong>, especially from the freezer compartment, a flawed evaporator fan motor could be at fault. Likewise, you may see that your refrigerator isn&#8217;t keeping the standard temperature of 37-38 degrees Fahrenheit, (0 degrees Fahrenheit for freezers). You may also need a\u00a0<strong>refrigerator repair\u00a0<\/strong>if\u00a0your ice is taking more time to solidify than usual.<\/p>\n<p>To examine the evaporator fan and motor, you should unplug your fridge and take out the evaporator fan cover. On the off chance that there is ice or frost causing the noise, then you should search for a defrost issue as the source of the problem. You can briefly reconnect the power source to help stop the noise, however, please use caution around live circuits. Remember, any refrigerator repair should be conducted only by trained\u00a0<strong>refrigerator repairman<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h3><b>MORE ABOUT THIS REFRIGERATOR REPAIR<\/b><\/h3>\n<div id=\"Central_Content_SymptomPartsList_Difficulty_1\">&#8211; Customers rate this repair as Easy<\/div>\n<div id=\"Central_Content_SymptomPartsList_Duration_1\">&#8211; 30 &#8211; 60 minutes<\/div>\n<h2>Evaporator Fan Motor Grommet<\/h2>\n<p><strong>NOTE: DO NOT ATTEMPT ANY REPAIRS WITHOUT TRAINING.
