Please make sure that your freezer always maintains a temperature of approximately zero degrees Fahrenheit or lower. This is to ensure that your food is kept at the appropriate temperature to remain frozen. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the FDA, keeping food frozen at these certain temperatures cannot only ensure safe storage but prevent the growth of bacteria as well, such as <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salmonella, E. coli O157: H7 <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C. botulinum <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which causes botulism.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>You can refer to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.com\/pin\/217017275764089337\/\">FDA food storage times chart<\/a> for more information.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2><b>Common Freezer Issues We Handle<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our technicians at Seattle Fridge Repair is able to conduct any type of repair as long as the repair is not limited by the unavailability of parts from the manufacturer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be sure to call us at (206)-503-9431 if you notice any of the following:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Freezer is not powering on<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure that your appliance is plugged in, its power switch is on, and its breakers are functioning properly?

It is also one that has many possible symptoms. First, check to see if the door of your freezer is\/was open for extended periods of time. Second, have you adjusted the temperature controls of your gadget? Is there a visible\/audible gap in the seals within your freezer doors? !!!An easy way to check your door seals is to place a dollar bill halfway into your freezer and close the door. If you can easily pull out your bill, your door seals are defective!!!<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Freezer emits unusual sounds during operation<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abnormal noises coming from your freezer could be a sign of a compressor and or engine failure. If left alone, this could even lead to a fully unrepairable freezer and would require you to buy a new one. We can help you save money and time by repairing your freezer ASAP.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_389\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-389\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-389 lazyload\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-src=\"https:\/\/subzerovikingrepair.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/refrigerator-buzzing-noises-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-389\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-389 lazyload\" src=\"https:\/\/subzerovikingrepair.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/refrigerator-buzzing-noises-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/noscript> Do not be the person above.
