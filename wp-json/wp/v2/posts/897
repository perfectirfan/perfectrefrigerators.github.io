THE FOLLOWING ARTICLE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Our technicians say that from experience, the ice maker is oftentimes the first part to break after the purchase of a new\u00a0<strong>Sub-Zero refrigerator\u00a0<\/strong>or\u00a0<strong>Viking refrigerator<\/strong>. After all, a small integrated ice maker is held to similar expectations to that of a separate ice machine! A regular refrigerator ice maker produces approximately 3.5 to 6.6 lbs of ice per day. However, an ice maker tray will only hold 4-11 lbs of ice per day. This is why the ice maker should shut off after the limit of ice has been reached, to prevent a leaking refrigerator.<\/p>\n<p>An exceptional\u00a0good ice maker, such as in a\u00a0<strong>Sub-Zero<\/strong> appliance,\u00a0produces about 8 to 10 ice cubes every 90 minutes. This makes for 16 cycles a day, in other words, 130 ice cubes every 24 hours. If that is not enough, which is the case for most vendors, we recommend purchasing a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.subzero-wolf.com\/sub-zero\/counter-refrigerator\/15-inch-ice-maker-panel-ready\"><strong>Sub-Zero ice machine.<\/strong><\/a> The main issue that could be branching off of your ice maker is ice dispensation itself. Cubes can stick together, forming a giant lump of ice. They can also be too small, or just not be produced at all.<\/p>\n<h3>Ice Maker: What to suspect<\/h3>\n<p>If your ice maker doesn&#8217;t produce ice or makes very small ice cubes, the main issue is a lack of water, due to an interrupted water fill system. First, examine the fill tube and fill cup to ensure they are not frozen. If you do see that the fill tube\/cup are frozen, make sure that no unfamiliar objects disrupt water from flowing into the fill cup. If no foreign objects block the water flow, then the issue is with the inlet valve\/tubing. However, this repair requires a\u00a0<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/subzerovikingrepair.com\/contact-us\/\">licensed refrigerator technician<\/a>\u00a0<\/strong>for obvious safety reasons<\/p>\n<h3><b>MORE ABOUT THIS REPAIR<\/b><\/h3>\n<div id=\"Central_Content_SymptomPartsList_Difficulty_2\">&#8211; Customers rate this repair as EASY<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div id=\"Central_Content_SymptomPartsList_Duration_2\">&#8211; 15 \u2013 30 minutes<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<h2>Other Leaking Refrigerator Issues<\/h2>\n<p>In this series of blogs, we&#8217;ve mentioned the most common issues\/parts that can cause a leaky refrigerator, freezer.
