THE FOLLOWING ARTICLE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In order to ensure that your food is safely sealed from warmth when your\u00a0<strong>Sub-Zero, Viking refrigerator\u00a0<\/strong>is closed, manufacturers use door gasket and\/or seals to keep out warm air. Generally, door gaskets\/seals are located on the outside of your refrigerator&#8217;s doors. These parts are made from vinyl (a.k.a. PVC), and usually have a flexible metal piece, that connects with the cabinet when the refrigerator door is closed to provide an airtight seal. In the event that air does leak through the gasket, there will most likely be excess moisture inside the refrigerator, freezer or cooler.<\/p>\n<p>Eventually, this can lead to <strong>defrost issues<\/strong> and\u00a0a\u00a0leaking refrigerator<strong>,\u00a0<\/strong>which will require a\u00a0<strong>professional appliance repair<\/strong>. One thing you can do yourself is to check the condition of your gaskets is to ensure that there is no distortion or damage on the sides.

THE FOLLOWING ARTICLE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Another part that could be causing leaks in your refrigerator is the water inlet valve. This\u00a0<strong>refrigerator part\u00a0<\/strong>connects\u00a0to your house&#8217;s water and supplies it to the ice maker and water dispensary system. Typically, the water inlet valve is located at the back of your refrigerator, near the bottom. In a normal residential appliance, the valve does not pump water continuously, but only works when activated by the dispenser\/ice maker. Hence, if you have a steadily leaking refrigerator, it is possible that your main control board is also at fault.<\/p>\n<p>Please do not attempt any repairs, as you can damage the underside of your appliance, as well as your hardwood floor, especially if you have a high-end\u00a0<strong>built-in\u00a0refrigerator<\/strong> such as\u00a0<strong>Sub-Zero\u00a0<\/strong>or\u00a0<strong>Viking.<\/strong>\u00a0Our technicians use special floor protectors to move the refrigerator or freezer around, among other safety precautions.<\/p>\n<h3><b>MORE ABOUT THIS REPAIR<\/b><\/h3>\n<div id=\"Central_Content_SymptomPartsList_Difficulty_1\">&#8211; Customers rate this repair as EASY<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div id=\"Central_Content_SymptomPartsList_Duration_1\">&#8211; Average repair time: 15 -30 minutes<\/div>\n<div>\n<hr \/>\n<p>For more information, please visit our <a href=\"https:\/\/subzerovikingrepair.com\/company-news\/\">general news area.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>You can contact us for any specific questions or comments you may have with our <a href=\"https:\/\/subzerovikingrepair.com\/contact-us\/\">contact page.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>To contact us faster, please call (206)-456-4344.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The most diligent appliance in the home, the refrigerator is something you can&#8217;t survive without.
