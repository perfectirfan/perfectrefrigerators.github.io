This can include:<\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>fan sounds (moving cold air around different areas of the fridge)<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>pops (defrosting ice)<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>gurgling (liquid refrigerant circling the fridge)<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>hissing (difference in pressure between warm and cold air)<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>compressor noise<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><em>Make sure you have enough air space around the fridge.\u00a0If your fridge is making a lot of noise it may be because it doesn\u2019t have enough room to move hot air away to the surrounds, and needs to work harder to cool the fridge. The right amount of space can usually be found in the manual but if not, leaving at least 5\u201310cm around the sides, top and rear is generally enough. Install the fridge away from direct sunlight and any heat-generating appliances such as heaters, ovens, cooktops or dishwashers.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Check the controls to see if they are set to very cold.\u00a0The colder they are, the more likely the compressor is to run. This is also likely to happen if a large amount of food has just been placed in the fridge, as the fridge tries to cool the food down, or if you\u2019ve put something hot (like uncooled leftovers) into the fridge or freezer. The fridge compressor is also likely to run more often in warmer seasons.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Check what\u2019s on top or balanced against the fridge\u00a0\u2013 something could be vibrating against the fridge when the compressor starts up. This can also happen on the inside if something is awkwardly stored inside the fridge and vibrates against something else in response to the compressor vibration.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3><strong><em>The balance of Your Refrigerator<\/em><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><em>Check that your fridge is balanced. If it\u2019s unbalanced, meaning the doors don\u2019t close properly, it\u2019s costing you money as the compressor tries to replace cold air that leaks out the door. It can also cause increased noise. Fridges usually have feet that can be adjusted once you\u2019ve got them installed. Balance issues can also occur if the floor is weak or uneven.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3><strong><em>Fridge Performance<\/em><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><em>If your compressor is working hard but your food isn\u2019t getting cold, check that none of your food items are covering internal outlets. Cold air is always being pushed into the fridge through outlets in the fridge and freezer area. If you block these with an overloaded fridge you\u2019ll make the fridge work harder. Leave space around the outlets so cool air can circulate. Check that nothing is in the way and that the door is closing properly. Opening the door too often or leaving it open for too long will also make it difficult for the fridge to cool food.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3><strong><em>Fridge Frosting up<\/em><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><em>These days most fridges are frost-free. If yours has frost build-up, check the doors are fully closed and that the seals are air-tight. Seals that are dirty, faulty or deteriorating with age will allow humid air to leak in. Faulty seals mean the compressor can\u2019t deal with the amount of moisture in the fridge, which then freezes to the sides of the freezer door. If it\u2019s really serious, you may have issues opening the fridge.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3><strong><em>Cleaning of Refrigerators<\/em><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><em>Most manufacturers will tell you to turn off your fridge before cleaning, so it\u2019s best to clean when your food supply is low. Use a mild unscented detergent and lukewarm water with a soft cloth on the interior and the outside of the fridge. Make sure all parts, including the seals, are thoroughly dried after washing and avoid wetting any controls or electronic areas. Thoroughly wiping up any spills as they occur will help in the long run. Try not to use any abrasives.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3><em>What is Fridge Smells<\/em><\/h3>\n<p><em>This can be related to what you\u2019ve put in the fridge. Check what\u2019s in there, as something may have spilled and started to spoil, or may not be covered properly. Some containers and wrappers can cause smells or react with food to create smells.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3><strong><em>Water Leaks from the Fridge<\/em><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><em>If water is\u00a0leaking outside the fridge,\u00a0check the back of the fridge to see if the defrost water tray is in the right position and that the drainage tube that leads to it is actually pointing at the drip tray. This water should evaporate naturally over time.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>If water is\u00a0leaking inside the fridge\u00a0it could mean there is a blocked drain or outlet. There are drainage channels in some fridge cabinets, so check to see if there is a blockage of food or dirt and clear it. If drainage channels aren\u2019t blocked, the leak could be from condensation so check the door is closing properly, isn\u2019t left opened for too long and that the seals are working well. This can also happen when there are periods of high humidity in the environment.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>If water is leaking\u00a0in the vegetable\/fruit compartments\u00a0it could be because of the low humidity in the fridge that vegetables and fruit will lose water which can cause condensation on the compartments they are stored in. If your fridge has a humidity setting, try using this to see if it makes a difference. You could also use storage bags to store the vegetables and fruit in the compartments.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3><strong><em>Food is freezing in the fridge<\/em><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><em>You\u2019ll need to check the temperature setting. Adjust the temperature and see if food is still freezing in the fridge. Leave the fridge for 24 hours to register any changes you\u2019ve made to the temperature settings. Cold-sensitive foods (easily frozen) placed in front of vents used for the cold air circulation are likely to be affected, so make sure you keep vents free of products.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3><strong><em>Moving your Fridge<\/em><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><em>If you move your fridge, you don\u2019t want to hurt yourself or cause damage to your fridge in the process. Cooling down will take two or three hours. After that, close and tape drawers and doors and make sure the power lead is tucked into the back or taped to the fridge.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>If the fridge needs to be laid down on it side, when moved upright again leave it to rest for a while before turning the power back on. Check your manual for resting periods but it ranges from 10 minutes to a few hours.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3><strong><em>Ice and water-dispenser issues<\/em><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><em>For fridges containing ice and\/or water compartments, check for any water leaks at all water connection points. Follow manufacturer instructions for replacing any filters. If the ice maker doesn\u2019t make ice, it could be that it\u2019s turned off or that the fridge isn\u2019t level. Also, check the filter for blockages and that the tap supply to the fridge is turned on.<\/em><\/p>\n<h5><a href=\"https:\/\/subzerovikingrepair.com\/make-appointment\/\"><em><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-184 size-full lazyload\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-src=\"https:\/\/subzerovikingrepair.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/img_3348.jpg\" alt=\"Seattle Fridge Repair - Sub-Zero Thermador GE Viking\" width=\"453\" height=\"181\" \/><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-184 size-full lazyload\" src=\"https:\/\/subzerovikingrepair.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/img_3348.jpg\" alt=\"Seattle Fridge Repair - Sub-Zero Thermador GE Viking\" width=\"453\" height=\"181\" \/><\/noscript><\/em><\/a><\/h5>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s fair to expect your refrigerator to last a long time.
