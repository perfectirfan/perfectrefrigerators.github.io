The refrigerator is one of the only appliances that works 24\/7\/365, which means that many parts are overworked extremely quickly if they are not of high quality. Nevertheless, Seattle Fridge Repair replaces your refrigerator only with the best quality parts.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almost always, only a professional technician can fix the given problem. Many people will try to do a DIY repair on their refrigerator as soon as possible as it contains their food and medicine, however, it could actually be damaging to your refrigerator. What you need is a professional team of experienced professionals that provide FAST, FRIENDLY and EFFICIENT services, which we do.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some common problems and symptoms that can help you diagnose what is troubling your refrigerator and relay it to us.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Fridge Over Cooling.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, fridges are made to be cold, however, sometimes a fridge can overwork and technically act as a freezer. A possible cause of this is if too much ice has been dispensed recently. In this case, the fridge will cool down, so that it can return its ice levels back to normal. In extreme cases, the fridge will also lower the temperature of the freezer.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Fridge is Not Making Ice.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, a fridge not making enough ice, or no ice at all, is a sign of an ice maker problem. Depending on your refrigerator, a malfunctioning ice maker can lead to problems in other parts of your refrigerator.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Please see our ice maker repair page for more information:<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/subzerovikingrepair.com\/ice-maker-repair\/\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?hl=en&amp;q=https:\/\/subzerovikingrepair.com\/2018\/02\/13\/ice-maker-repair\/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1519688557038000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEJtV0lLjzvUWCq2Eduz2EwoJWogg\">https:\/\/subzerovikingrepair.com\/2018\/02\/13\/ice-maker-repair\/<\/a><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Water Leaking.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there is water puddling near or in your fridge,<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><u>CALL US IMMEDIATELY!<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although a leak may only happen once or twice, it is a sign of a serious refrigerator problem, which can quickly escalate to a big water leak. In a worst-case scenario, an unattended water leak can flood your entire kitchen overnight and cause tens of thousands of dollars in damages to your refrigerator, floor, cabinets and more.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, water leaks can be caused by a defrost malfunction. If its cycle is interrupted and is later resumed, it can trigger a major water outflow caused by extra ice being formed. While the defrost cycle is a normal process in a refrigerator, when disturbed can be damaging to your fridge.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Common problems caused by water leaks.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ice maker malfunction<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Defective water valve<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frozen water valve<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Punctured drain pan<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ice forming on food<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Improper Temperature Control.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In most modern fridges, the temperature is controlled automatically. However, when the temperature rises above a certain level, there is an audible click and the thermostat will start working. Your fridge toggles the thermostat on\/off as needed to maintain proper temperatures. Since thermostats are generally mechanical, they will emit certain noises prior to dying out.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there are other issues that could alter your fridge\u2019s performance, the ones listed above are the ones we encounter the most during repairs. Please keep in mind that your fridge could have multiple problems affecting it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>Thank you very much for reading and we hope that you will choose our company as your refrigerator repair contractor.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><u>Contact Us:<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seattle Fridge Repair<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">206.203.COOL (2665)<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"mailto:service@subzerovikingrepair.com\">service@subzerovikingrepair.com<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Unlike other appliances, it is extremely hard to survive in today\u2019s society without a refrigerator that is not properly working.
